# ra1nstorm
Tethered downgrade 64-bit iDevices vulnerable to checkm8

## This is the legacy version of ra1nstorm, before getting majorly updated. I want to keep this code because this is my first major project ever. TLDR; it's very important to me. Feel free to have a look at it whenever you want

Since the purpose of this tool is to tethered downgrade a device, after restoring please use one of the tools listed below to tethered boot it:
* [Ramiel](https://github.com/MatthewPierson/Ramiel)
* [PyBoot](https://github.com/MatthewPierson/PyBoot)
* [ra1nsn0w](https://github.com/tihmstar/ra1nsn0w)

ra1nstorm now supports downgrading untethered from any iOS to iOS 10.3.3 on some A7 devices
## Before using it, please keep in mind
YOU are fully responsible to any data loss or damaged cause to your device while using ra1nstorm
## Usage
```
usage: ra1nstorm iPSW [-u] [-s PATH] [-t BLOB]

  iPSW                  iPSW file used for restoring

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t BLOB, --blob BLOB  Manually specify SHSH used for restoring (SHSH will be
                        automatically saved if this argument is skipped)
  -s PATH, --save-log PATH
                        Specify path for saving futurerestore log
